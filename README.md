# Algorithmic-Problem-Solving-Moving-Home

Variant of bin packing problem. Program efficiently packed the truck with the boxes in different size, kept position of each box and unpacked the truck considering different variations of chains of people. Done in 2D and 3D volume with all possible sorting orders. Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, recursive approach and dynamic programming. Performed theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of each of the approaches.
